## Project Overview

### Formal Introduction
The Library Management System is a comprehensive desktop application designed to streamline library operations. Built with modern Java technologies, it provides a robust, secure, and user-friendly interface for managing library resources, user accounts, and administrative functions. The system implements industry-standard practices for data management, security, and user experience.

### ELI5 Introduction
Imagine you have a huge library with thousands of books, and you need to keep track of:
- Who borrowed which book
- When books need to be returned
- Where each book is located
- Who can access what
- How to make sure everything is organized

This system is like having a super-smart helper who:
- Knows exactly where every book is
- Remembers who borrowed what
- Can find books quickly
- Makes sure only the right people can access certain things
- Helps librarians do their job more easily

## System Architecture

### Formal Architecture
The system follows a layered architecture pattern:
1. **Presentation Layer**: JavaFX-based UI components
2. **Business Logic Layer**: Service classes handling core operations
3. **Data Access Layer**: Hibernate ORM for database operations
4. **Security Layer**: Authentication and authorization services
5. **Integration Layer**: External service communication

### ELI5 Architecture
Think of the system like a well-organized office building:
- The ground floor (Presentation Layer) is where visitors come in - it's pretty and easy to use
- The middle floors (Business Logic) are where the real work happens
- The basement (Data Access) is where we store all our important papers
- The security desk (Security Layer) makes sure only the right people get in
- The mail room (Integration Layer) handles communication with the outside world

        // Database operation
        return bookRepository.save(book);
    }
    
    public List<Book> searchBooks(String query) {
        // Business logic processing
        String searchQuery = processSearchQuery(query);
        // Database operation
        return bookRepository.findByTitle(searchQuery);
    }
}
```

    public void borrowBook(Long userId, Long bookId) {
        // Start transaction
        Book book = bookRepository.findById(bookId);
        User user = userRepository.findById(userId);
        
        // Business logic
        if (book.isAvailable() && user.canBorrow()) {
            book.setAvailable(false);
            bookRepository.save(book);
            // Create transaction record
            createTransaction(user, book);
        }
        // Commit transaction
    }
}
```

            .username("library_user")
            .password("secure_password")
            .build();
    }

    }
}
```

        logger.error("Database error occurred", ex);
        
        // Create appropriate response
        ErrorResponse response = new ErrorResponse(
            "Database operation failed",
            ex.getMessage()
        );
        
        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)

        if (book.getTitle() == null || book.getTitle().trim().isEmpty()) {
            errors.add("Title cannot be empty");
        }
        
        if (book.getIsbn() != null && !isValidIsbn(book.getIsbn())) {
            errors.add("Invalid ISBN format");
        }
        
        if (!errors.isEmpty()) {

        if (cachedBook != null) {
            return cachedBook;
        }
        
        // If not in cache, get from database
        Book book = bookRepository.findById(id);

            List<Book> batch = books.subList(i, 
                Math.min(i + batchSize, books.size()));
            bookRepository.saveAll(batch);

## Database Design

### Library Database Overview

The library database (`library_db`) is the core data storage system that manages all library operations. It's designed to handle book inventory, user management, and transaction tracking efficiently.

### Database Schema

#### 1. Core Tables

##### Users Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    role VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```
- **Purpose**: Stores user authentication and authorization information
- **Key Fields**:
  - `id`: Unique identifier for each user
  - `username`: User's login name (unique)
  - `password_hash`: Securely hashed password
  - `email`: User's email address (unique)
  - `role`: User's role (admin/student)
  - `created_at`: Account creation timestamp

##### Books Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE books (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    author VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    isbn VARCHAR(13) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    publication_year INT,
    category VARCHAR(50),
    status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    location VARCHAR(50)
);
```
- **Purpose**: Manages book inventory and metadata
- **Key Fields**:
  - `id`: Unique identifier for each book
  - `title`: Book title
  - `author`: Book author
  - `isbn`: International Standard Book Number (unique)
  - `publication_year`: Year the book was published
  - `category`: Book category/genre

##### Transactions Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE transactions (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    user_id BIGINT,
    book_id BIGINT,
    transaction_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    transaction_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    due_date TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES books(id)
);
```
- **Purpose**: Tracks all book-related transactions
- **Key Fields**:
  - `id`: Unique identifier for each transaction
  - `user_id`: Reference to user who made the transaction
  - `book_id`: Reference to the book involved
  - `transaction_type`: Type of transaction (Borrow/Return/Reserve)
  - `transaction_date`: When the transaction occurred
  - `due_date`: When the book should be returned

### Database Operations

#### 1. Common Queries

##### Book Search
```sql
SELECT * FROM books 
WHERE title LIKE ? OR author LIKE ? OR isbn = ?;
```
- Searches books by title, author, or ISBN
- Uses LIKE for partial matches on text fields
- Exact match for ISBN

##### User Authentication
```sql
SELECT * FROM users 
WHERE username = ? AND password_hash = ?;
```
- Verifies user credentials
- Uses hashed password comparison
- Returns user details if match found

##### Active Borrowings
```sql
SELECT b.title, b.author, t.transaction_date, t.due_date
FROM transactions t
JOIN books b ON t.book_id = b.id
WHERE t.user_id = ? AND t.transaction_type = 'BORROW'
AND t.due_date > CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
```
- Lists currently borrowed books for a user
- Shows due dates
- Only includes active borrowings

#### 2. Data Management

##### Adding New Books
```sql
INSERT INTO books (title, author, isbn, publication_year, category, status, location)
VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, 'Available', ?);
```
- Adds new books to inventory
- Sets initial status as 'Available'
- Requires all mandatory fields

##### Processing Book Returns
```sql
UPDATE books SET status = 'Available' WHERE id = ?;
INSERT INTO transactions (user_id, book_id, transaction_type, transaction_date)
VALUES (?, ?, 'RETURN', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);
```
- Updates book status
- Records return transaction
- Maintains transaction history

### Database Optimization

#### 1. Indexes
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_books_title ON books(title);
CREATE INDEX idx_books_author ON books(author);
CREATE INDEX idx_books_isbn ON books(isbn);
CREATE INDEX idx_transactions_user ON transactions(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_transactions_book ON transactions(book_id);
```
- Improves search performance
- Optimizes foreign key lookups
- Speeds up common queries

#### 2. Constraints
```sql
ALTER TABLE transactions
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_user_transaction
FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_book_transaction
FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES books(id);
```
- Ensures data integrity
- Prevents orphaned records
- Maintains referential integrity
