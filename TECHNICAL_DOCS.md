# Library Management System - Technical Documentation

## Project Overview
This is a desktop-based Library Management System built using Java and JavaFX. The application provides a modern, user-friendly interface for managing library operations including book management, user authentication, and administrative functions.

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
1. **Java 17** (Think of it like a universal language)
   - Imagine you're writing a letter that anyone in the world can read
   - Java is like a special language that computers can understand
   - It's like having a universal translator that works on any computer
   - Just like how you can write the same letter in different places, Java programs work on different computers
   - The number 17 is like the version of the language - it's the newest and best version

2. **JavaFX 17.0.2** (Think of it like building with LEGO blocks)
   - Imagine you're building a house with LEGO blocks
   - JavaFX is like a big box of special LEGO pieces that help you build computer programs
   - It gives you ready-made pieces (buttons, text boxes, windows) that you can snap together
   - FXML is like having a picture of how to build something - it's a blueprint that tells the computer how to arrange all the pieces
   - Just like how you can build different things with the same LEGO pieces, you can create many different types of programs with JavaFX
   - The best part is that these pieces work together smoothly and look nice on the screen

3. **Maven** (Think of it like a smart shopping assistant)
   - Imagine you're building a big LEGO set
   - Maven is like having a helper who:
     - Keeps track of all the pieces you need
     - Makes sure you have the right pieces
     - Helps you put everything together in the right order
     - Checks if everything works correctly
   - It's like having a recipe book that:
     - Lists all the ingredients (dependencies) you need
     - Tells you how to mix them (build process)
     - Makes sure you don't forget anything
   - The best part is that it does all this automatically, so you don't have to worry about missing pieces or wrong versions

### Database Layer
1. **MySQL** (Think of it like a digital filing cabinet)
   - Imagine you have a huge filing cabinet where you keep all your important papers
   - MySQL is like a super-organized digital filing cabinet
   - It keeps all your information in neat, organized folders
   - Just like how you can quickly find a paper in a well-organized cabinet, MySQL helps you find information quickly
   - It's like having a magical cabinet that can hold millions of papers and find any one of them instantly

2. **Hibernate 6.2.13** (Think of it like a magical translator)
   - Imagine you're trying to talk to someone who speaks a different language
   - Hibernate is like having a magical translator that:
     - Helps Java (your program) talk to MySQL (the database)
     - Automatically translates between Java objects and database tables
     - Makes sure everything is saved correctly
   - It's like having a helper who:
     - Takes your Java objects and puts them in the right boxes in the database
     - When you need something back, it finds the right box and gives it to you
     - Keeps everything organized and neat
   - The best part is that you don't need to learn the database's special language - Hibernate handles all the translation for you

### Security & Authentication
1. **BCrypt** (Think of it like a secret code maker)
   - Imagine you have a special way to write your secret messages
   - BCrypt is like a magical code maker that:
     - Takes your password and turns it into a secret code
     - Makes it impossible for anyone to figure out your original password
     - Keeps your passwords safe, like having a secret language only you understand
   - It's like having a special lock that can't be picked

2. **JavaMail API** (Think of it like a digital post office)
   - Imagine you have a magical post office that can send messages instantly
   - JavaMail is like having a digital post office that:
     - Sends emails automatically
     - Can tell you when important things happen
     - Works with different types of email systems
   - It's like having a helper who delivers messages to the right people at the right time

### Testing Framework
1. **JUnit 5** (Think of it like a quality checker)
   - Imagine you're making sure all your toys work correctly
   - JUnit is like having a checklist that:
     - Makes sure each part of your program works
     - Tests everything automatically
     - Tells you if something is broken
   - It's like having a helper who checks everything before you use it

2. **Mockito** (Think of it like a pretend friend)
   - Imagine you're playing with toys but need someone to play with
   - Mockito is like having pretend friends that:
     - Act like real parts of your program
     - Help you test things without needing the real thing
     - Make testing easier and faster
   - It's like having a helper who pretends to be other parts of your program

### Additional Libraries
1. **OkHttp** (Think of it like a digital messenger)
   - Imagine you need to send messages to other computers
   - OkHttp is like having a fast messenger that:
     - Carries messages between computers
     - Makes sure messages arrive safely
     - Can handle different types of messages
   - It's like having a reliable delivery service for your computer

2. **JSON Libraries** (Think of it like a universal translator for data)
   - Imagine you need to share information with different types of computers
   - JSON libraries are like having translators that:
     - Help computers understand each other
     - Make information easy to share
     - Work with different types of data
   - It's like having a universal language that all computers can understand

## How Technologies Work Together

1. **User Interface Flow**
   - JavaFX creates the visual interface
   - FXML files define the UI layout
   - Controllers handle user interactions
   - Events trigger appropriate service layer methods

2. **Data Flow**
   - User actions are processed by controllers
   - Service layer contains business logic
   - Hibernate manages database operations
   - Data is stored in MySQL database

3. **Security Flow**
   - User credentials are validated
   - BCrypt hashes passwords before storage
   - Session management handles user authentication
   - JavaMail sends notifications for security events

4. **Testing Flow**
   - JUnit tests verify individual components
   - Mockito creates mock objects for testing
   - H2 database provides test data storage
   - Maven runs tests during build process
